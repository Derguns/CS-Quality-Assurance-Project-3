# Requirements for Web Application

1. Upon accessing the main page ("/", i.e., `http://localhost:4567`), the system shall display a page with three textboxes and a single submit button, arranged together and each labeled.  The first textbox shall be labeled "True symbol:", the second textbox "False symbol:", and the third textbox "Size (2^x):".  The button shall be labeled "Show truth table".
   Complete, form with text boxes.
2. In addition to data already specified, all pages, including the main page itself, shall include a link back to the main page ("/", i.e., `http://localhost:4567`); however, the text in the link may differ from page to page.
   Table page, index page, input error page, and 404 page all contain links.
3. If the "Show truth table" button is pressed and the data is invalid, then an error page containing the text "ERROR" in an H1 tag, and "Invalid parameters." shall be displayed, along with a description explaining the rules for valid data (see below).
    Input error page is to specifications.
4. Data shall be considered valid if both the true and false symbols are single characters and are distinct from each other (i.e., they shall not be the same character), and that the size is an integer with a value of 2 or greater.
    Input error occurs under these circumstances.
5. Upon pressing "Show truth table" with valid parameters, a truth table shall be constructed and displayed using the specified true and false symbols.  The top row shall include a descriptor of the value/"bit" (descending, i.e., it should start with the highest number and descend to 0), along with an additional final four column designators labeled "AND", "OR", "NAND", "NOR" in that order.
    The table is generated with proper headings.
6. Additionally, each row in the truth table shall include three additional columns, specifying the result of the AND, OR, NAND, and NOR operators.  For multi-element truth operations, we shall consider AND(values) to be true if and only if all elements are true (e.g., "111" is true, but "110" is false); we shall consider OR(values) to be true if and only if any element is true (e.g., "010" is true, but "000" is false); we shall consider NAND to be true if and only if NOT(AND(values)) is true; we shall consider NOR to be true if and only if NOT(OR(values)) is true.
    The table properly processes each and / or / nand / nor value as specified.
7. If no data is entered on the main page in a particular textbox, the default value shall be used.  The default value for the true symbol is "T", the default value for the false symbol is "F", and the default value for the size is "3".
    No data results in a 3 table with T and F.
8. If a user goes to a URL other than one specified (e.g., "http://localhost:4567/hotdog"), the system shall display a page stating "ERROR" (in an h1 tag),as well as the text, "Invalid address.", along with a 404 error code.
    Any other URL than the post or the index displays a 404 to specifications.
    
Tests:
  Index page has all inputs specified and labelled correctly.
  There is a link to the main page on the index, table, error, and input_error pages at the bottom.
  The input error page has error in an H1 tag, invalid parameters, and the rules for the data to specifications.
  Data is invalid if true symbol is not a single character.
  Data is invalid if false symbol is not a single character.
  Data is invalid if both symbols are the same single character.
  Data is invalid if the size is not an integer.
  Data is invalid if the size is less than 2.
  Truth table is constructed using the specified true / false symbols.
  Truth table constructed with the correct amount of headers, starting from the highest number to 0.
  Truth table contains and, or, nand, and nor columns.
  Truth table row size is 2 ^ x.
  Truth table properly generates the values for the and, or, nand, nor columns.
  Truth table properly generates the values for the table bits.
  Truth table uses default values when no values are entered. (T, F, and 3)
  Any URL other than the default has a 404 with error page to specifications.
  Truth table properly generates values with large (> 100 ) size.
